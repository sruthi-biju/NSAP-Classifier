# NSAP-Classifier
A classification model for National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), which can predict the most appropriate NSAP scheme for an applicant based on their demographic and socio-economic data.

IBM Cloud has been used for the cloud computation using the watsonx ai studio & runtime services. Using their Auto AI feature, we performed the machine learning experiment on the 'District wise pension' dataset taken from the AIKosh Dataset platform.

From the machine learning experiment, 9 pipelines were generated from the algorithm - in which Pipeline 9 was the best performing model with following attributes: 

- Algorithm Model: Batched Tree Ensemble Classifier - LGBM

- Accuracy: 1.0 (100%)

- Enhancements: HPO-1, HPO-2, FE, BATCH

- Build Time: 35 seconds

The P9 - LGBM Classifier: NSAP_ML model has been deployed online for taking real time entries using IBM Cloud itself. The input features for the model are : 
finyear, lgdstatecode, statename, lgddistrictcode, districtname, totalmale, totalfemale, totaltransgender, totalsc, totalst, totalgen, totalobc, totalaadhaar & totalmpbilenumber. 
The target variable for the same is schemecode â€” This is the multi-class label (e.g., IGNDPS, IGNOAPS, IGNWPS)

Using Streamlit - an opensource python framework, an app was made for the model so that its easier to use for the public, given its simple and easy to use interface.
